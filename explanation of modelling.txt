Here's an interpretation of the results obtained from the three regression models:

Linear Regression:
The model explains around 66.59% of the variance in the target variable on the training data.
The R-squared score for the test set (0.6685) indicates decent generalization.
The relatively lower scores compared to other models suggest that the linear relationship might not fully capture the data's complexity.
XGBoostRegressor:
It explains a significant portion (94.41%) of the variance in the target variable on the training data.
While the test set R-squared score is slightly lower, it still performs well, indicating good generalization.
The high R-squared values suggest that it captures a substantial amount of variability.
RandomForestRegressor:
The MSE provides insight into the model's average predictive error on the test set.Comparing MSE with other models helps assess relative performance.

The R-squared score for the test set (0.8208) indicates decent generalization.

The relatively higher scores compared to Lineer Regression model. But for the XGBoostRegressor, it's lower scores suggest that the linear relationship might not fully capture the data's complexity.

Overall Assessment:

XGBoostRegressor stands out as the best-performing model with high R-squared values and good generalization.
